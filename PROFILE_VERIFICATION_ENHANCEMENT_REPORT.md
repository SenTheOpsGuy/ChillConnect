## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// New state management for verification flows
const [verificationLoading, setVerificationLoading] = useState({})
const [verificationMessages, setVerificationMessages] = useState({})
const [otpInputs, setOtpInputs] = useState({})

// Handler functions for each verification type
const handleSendEmailVerification = async () => { /* Send email OTP */ }
const handleVerifyEmailOTP = async () => { /* Verify email OTP */ }
const handleSendPhoneVerification = async () => { /* Send phone OTP */ }
const handleVerifyPhoneOTP = async () => { /* Verify phone OTP */ }
const handleDocumentVerification = () => { /* Upload documents */ }
const handleRefreshStatus = async () => { /* Refresh verification status */ }
```

### Backend Implementation
```javascript
// Memory-based OTP storage for development
global.otpStore = global.otpStore || {};

// OTP generation and validation
const otp = Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000).toString();
const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 10 * 60 * 1000); // 10 minutes

// JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
```

- ✅ **Phone Pending** → "Send SMS" button → OTP input → "Verify" button → Real-time success  
- ✅ **Age Pending** → "Upload ID" button → File picker → Document submission → Status update
- ✅ **Account Pending** → "Refresh" button → Status synchronization → Updated display

## 🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Call-to-Action Buttons:
```jsx
// Email verification button with loading state
<button onClick={handleSendEmailVerification} disabled={verificationLoading.email}>
  {verificationLoading.email ? <LoadingSpinner /> : <FiSend />}
  <span>Send OTP</span>
</button>

// Progressive OTP input that appears after sending
{otpInputs.emailSent && (
  <div className="flex space-x-1">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter OTP" />
    <button onClick={handleVerifyEmailOTP}>
      <FiCheck />
    </button>
  </div>
