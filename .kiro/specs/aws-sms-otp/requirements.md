# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement AWS messaging integration for sending various types of messages to users, including One-Time Passwords (OTP), booking confirmations, notifications, and other transactional messages. The system will use AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to deliver SMS messages to users' mobile phones, enhancing security through multi-factor authentication and improving user experience with timely notifications about important events.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS SNS Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure AWS SNS for sending SMS messages, so that the application can send OTP codes to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the AWS SNS service THEN the system SHALL create necessary IAM roles and policies with minimal permissions required for SMS functionality.
2. WHEN configuring AWS SNS THEN the system SHALL set up appropriate SMS sending preferences (Transactional, cost limits, etc.).
3. WHEN AWS credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them before saving.
4. WHEN AWS SNS is configured THEN the system SHALL provide a test mechanism to verify the setup.
5. IF AWS SNS configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages to help troubleshoot.

### Requirement 2: OTP Generation Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a secure OTP generation service, so that unique and time-limited codes can be created for user verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OTP is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a random numeric code of configurable length (default 6 digits).
2. WHEN an OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL set an expiration time (configurable, default 10 minutes).
3. WHEN an OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL store it securely with the user identifier and expiration time.
4. IF an OTP is requested for a user with an existing valid OTP THEN the system SHALL either return the existing OTP or invalidate it and generate a new one based on configuration.
5. WHEN storing OTPs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

### Requirement 3: SMS Delivery Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive OTP codes via SMS, so that I can verify my identity without relying on email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OTP needs to be sent THEN the system SHALL use AWS SNS to deliver the message to the user's phone number.
2. WHEN sending an SMS THEN the system SHALL use a configurable message template that includes the OTP code.
3. WHEN an SMS is sent THEN the system SHALL handle and log delivery status (success, failure, etc.).
4. IF SMS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement a retry mechanism with configurable attempts and intervals.
5. WHEN sending SMS messages THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits imposed by AWS SNS.
6. IF a phone number is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user.

### Requirement 4: OTP Verification Process

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit my received OTP code, so that I can complete the verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an OTP THEN the system SHALL verify it against the stored OTP for that user.
2. WHEN verifying an OTP THEN the system SHALL check if the OTP has expired.
3. WHEN an OTP is successfully verified THEN the system SHALL mark the user's phone number as verified.
4. IF an incorrect OTP is submitted THEN the system SHALL allow a configurable number of retry attempts before temporary lockout.
5. WHEN maximum retry attempts are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement a temporary lockout period.
6. WHEN an OTP is successfully verified THEN the system SHALL invalidate the used OTP to prevent reuse.

### Requirement 5: API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined APIs for OTP operations, so that frontend applications can easily integrate with the OTP system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs to initiate OTP verification THEN the system SHALL provide an API endpoint to request an OTP for a given phone number.
2. WHEN the frontend submits an OTP for verification THEN the system SHALL provide an API endpoint to verify the OTP.
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization.
4. WHEN API operations complete THEN the system SHALL return appropriate status codes and messages.
5. IF API operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information.

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of OTP operations, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP operations occur THEN the system SHALL log relevant information (timestamps, success/failure, etc.) without including the actual OTP codes.
2. WHEN SMS messages are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery metrics (success rate, latency, etc.).
3. WHEN errors occur in the OTP process THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting.
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN administrators SHALL have access to usage statistics and error rates.
5. IF unusual activity is detected (high failure rates, multiple requests from same user) THEN the system SHALL generate alerts.

### Requirement 7: Transactional and Notification Messages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive timely SMS notifications about bookings, appointments, and other important events, so that I can stay informed about my account activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking is confirmed THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation SMS to both the provider and seeker.
2. WHEN a booking is canceled or rescheduled THEN the system SHALL send notification SMS to affected parties.
3. WHEN a payment is processed THEN the system SHALL send a transaction confirmation SMS.
4. WHEN important account events occur (verification status change, etc.) THEN the system SHALL notify users via SMS.
5. WHEN sending notification messages THEN the system SHALL use configurable templates for different event types.
6. IF a user opts out of certain notification types THEN the system SHALL respect these preferences.
7. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL queue messages and handle delivery in an asynchronous manner.

### Requirement 8: Message Template Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage message templates for different types of communications, so that messages are consistent and can be updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the messaging system THEN the system SHALL provide a way to define and store message templates.
2. WHEN a template is needed THEN the system SHALL support variable substitution for personalizing messages.
3. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL provide version control to track changes.
4. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL select the appropriate template based on message type and user preferences.
5. IF a template exceeds SMS character limits THEN the system SHALL either truncate appropriately or split into multiple messages.
6. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL provide validation to ensure they meet SMS format requirements.

### Requirement 9: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the messaging system to follow security best practices, so that user data remains protected and compliant with regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the messaging system THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for message generation, storage, and delivery.
2. WHEN handling phone numbers THEN the system SHALL treat them as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) with appropriate protections.
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL comply with relevant data protection regulations.
4. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails for security-relevant events.
5. IF security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL have a process for rapid updates and patches.
6. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL comply with anti-spam regulations and industry best practices.
