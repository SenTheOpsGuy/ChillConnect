## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Frontend (Netlify):
```bash
# Build for production
./build-for-production.sh

# Deploy to Netlify
# 1. Go to netlify.com
# 2. New site from Git
# 3. Base: frontend, Build: npm run build, Publish: frontend/dist
```

### Backend (Railway):
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
# 1. Go to railway.app
# 2. New project from GitHub
# 3. Add PostgreSQL service
# 4. Configure environment variables
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

### Netlify Configuration:
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Build settings and redirects
- ✅ `frontend/_redirects` - SPA routing rules
- ✅ `.nvmrc` - Node.js version (18)
- ✅ `frontend/.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Backend Configuration:
- ✅ `backend/railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- ✅ `backend/Procfile` - Process configuration
- ✅ `backend/.env.production.example` - Production environment template

### Helper Scripts:

- ✅ `build-for-production.sh` - Production build script

## 🌐 Domain Setup

### Current Status:
- Domain: `chillconnect.in` (ready for Netlify)
- SSL: Will be automatic with Netlify
- DNS: Update CNAME to point to Netlify

### Required DNS Changes:
